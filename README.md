# TMAT3004-Bacheloroppgave

trainer is based on RetinaNet and detectron2 https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/tutorials/install.html#common-installation-issues

App is written in C++. I recommend QtCreator open-source, and msvc++ from Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition.

QtCreator can open the cmake file CMakeLists.txt

You need OpenCV, see https://medium.com/beesightsoft/build-opencv-opencv-contrib-on-windows-2e3b1ca96955
